                            User is also referred to as a “Member” below). Except with Cyi AI’s approval, one User may
                            only register one member account on the platform. Cyi AI may cancel or terminate a User’s
                            member account if we have reasons to suspect that the User has concurrently registered or
                            controlled two or more member accounts. Further, Cyi AI may reject User’s application for
                            registration for any reason at its sole discretion.<br><br>
                            4.2 Upon registration on the Platforms, Cyi AI shall assign an account and issue a member
                            ID and password (the latter shall be chosen by a registered User during registration) to
                            each registered User. <br><br>
                            4.3 A set of Member ID and password is unique to a single account. Each Member shall be
                            solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Member ID and
                            password and for all activities that occur under your account. No Member may share, assign,
                            or permit the use of your Member account, ID or password by another person outside the
                            Member’s own business entity. Member agrees to notify Cyi Ai immediately if you become
                            aware of any unauthorized use of your password or your account or any other breach of
                            security of your account.<br><br>
                            4.4 Member agrees that all activities that occur under your account (including without
                            limitation, posting any company or product information, clicking to accept any Additional
                            Agreements or rules, subscribing to or making any payment for any services, sending emails
                            using the email account or sending SMS), using third-party software or platform will be
                            deemed to have been authorized by the Member.<br><br>
                            4.5 Member acknowledges that sharing of your account with other persons, or allowing
                            multiple users outside of your business entity to use your account (collectively,
                            "multiple use"), may cause irreparable harm to Cyi Ai or other Users of the Platform.
                            Member shall indemnify Cyi Ai, our affiliates, directors, employees, agents and
                            representatives against any loss or damages (including but not limited to loss of profits)
                            suffered as a result of the multiple use of your account. Member also agrees that in case
                            of the multiple use of your account or Member’s failure to maintain the security of your
                            account, Cyi Ai shall not be liable for any loss or damages arising from such a breach and
                            shall have the right to suspend or terminate Member’s account without liability to
                            Member.<br><br>
                            <b>5. Member’s Responsibilities</b><br><br>
                            5.1 Each Member represents, warrants and agrees that (a) you have full power and authority
                            to accept the Terms, to grant the license and authorization and to perform the
